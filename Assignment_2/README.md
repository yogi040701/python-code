# Python Programming Tasks

This repository contains two simple Python scripts. Each script addresses a specific programming task.

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

-   **File:** `task1.py`
-   **Functionality:** This script prompts the user to enter an integer. It then determines whether the number is even or odd and prints the result to the console.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

-   **File:** `task2.py`
-   **Functionality:** This script calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop. The final sum is printed to the console.
